Enhancing Intrusion Detection in IoT Networks Using Federated Learning with Differential Privacy

ðŸ“‹ Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a novel Federated Learning (FL) framework with Differential Privacy (DP) for intrusion detection in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. The project aims to create a lightweight, privacy-preserving Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that can operate effectively in resource-constrained IoT environments.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives
Primary Goals
Lightweight Detection: Develop an IDS model optimized for resource-constrained IoT devices
Privacy Preservation: Implement differential privacy to protect sensitive data during training
Communication Efficiency: Minimize bandwidth usage through federated learning approach
Scalability: Support thousands of distributed IoT devices
Key Research Questions
How can federated learning improve intrusion detection while preserving privacy?
What is the optimal trade-off between privacy guarantees and detection accuracy?
How can we minimize communication overhead in resource-constrained IoT networks?

ðŸš€ Problem Statement
Traditional centralized Intrusion Detection Systems face significant challenges in IoT environments:
Privacy Risks: Centralized data collection exposes sensitive information
Resource Constraints: IoT devices have limited computational power and memory
Communication Limitations: Bandwidth restrictions and intermittent connectivity
Scalability Issues: Difficulty managing thousands of distributed devices
Regulatory Compliance: Need to comply with GDPR, HIPAA, and other privacy regulations

ðŸ’¡ Proposed Solution
Our framework combines:
Federated Learning: Enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data
Differential Privacy: Adds mathematical privacy guarantees through calibrated noise
Lightweight Architecture: Optimized neural network for edge device deployment
